# Project: UI Experiment
This project serves as an experiment playground for the research questions "Does differently colored buttons produce different conversion? Is there a difference between colored buttons and simple text links?" Here you will find general information about the project, as well as the theory, the experiment hypothesis, design, analysis, and interpretation of the results.

## Introduction
User Interfaces (UI) are generally composed of many elements. Each element has its own role for the efficiency of the user experience as well as the conversion rates of the web application. Even a small component, such as the call-to-action (CTA) button, require a lot of attention in order to meet the expected goals. A CTA button is an interactive UI element, which aims to induce people to take an action, such as purchase, contact, subscribe, download etc. The features of an effective CTA button design are size, color, shape, placement, and microcopy.<sup>1</sup>

In this experiment we would like to focus our attention to the color of the CTA button, and in order to do so, we have to vary only the color of the button in the different conditions to be measured, and keep all other aspects such as the size, the text, thee shape and the placement constant.
